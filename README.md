Peanut Sorter & Grader is an innovative web-based platform designed to connect farmers with peanut industry professionals by providing tools to sort, grade, and evaluate peanut quality based on parameters such as size, color, and condition. The platform is developed using HTML5 to structure the content and interface, while CSS3 ensures a visually appealing and responsive design. JavaScript powers the client-side logic, enabling dynamic interactions like real-time grading, form validations, and user interface updates. To support user authentication, product management, and grading data storage, Firebase is optionally integrated as a lightweight backend solution. Furthermore, the platform incorporates a machine learning model to predict oil extraction potential and estimate the cost per kilogram based on current market trends. This combination of frontend technologies with intelligent backend integration streamlines the post-harvest supply chain, reduces middlemen exploitation, and enhances pricing transparency, making it a practical and impactful tool for both farmers and industry buyers.
